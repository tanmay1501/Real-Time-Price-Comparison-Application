# Introduction:
As it is commonly practiced by many, before buying anything online we tend to compare the prices on various ecommerce platforms in quest of best available deal, which in turn, often becomes a time-consuming process. But what if we had a single platform where we can compare real time prices offered for same product on different website. This is where we offer a solution to this commonly faced problem in finding the best economical option of a particular product by comparing all the other option available in the marketplace considering the overhead expenses required to acquire that product such as distance, taxes, traveling time, etc.
# Information needs:
• Data of latest prices of the stores
• GPS location
• Hyper link of other websites
